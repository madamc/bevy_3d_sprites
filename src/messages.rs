Father Whitby has been making this visit for almost a year. He normally takes the newer novices since the older ones are better at coming up with excuses of being busy. He got me to come three times, but that wasn't entirely my fault. That's a story for another time, though.";

They contained magnificent imagery of tales from yore. He asked that I analyze and interpret as best I can so we might decipher the meanings woven into these tales. He said these were discovered from far away and that there are scores of bundles such as these yet to be found.";

pub const Message8: &str = "This first panel seems to depict a queen bestowing an errand on two subjects. By the looks of it, two marshalls of some sort. They are all in a room of stone with tapestries which suggests wealth, or at least whoever made the image is representing them so. I hope it's a good queen or a bad queen. I detest stories about monarchs that are luke warm, good for nothing but keeping the ruling machinery in order.";
